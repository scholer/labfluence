This is an implementation of the observer pattern.  It uses function
decorators to achieve the desired event registration mechanism.

class event(object):
    '''
    This class serves as a utility to decorate a function as an event.

    The following example demonstrates its functionality in an abstract way.
    A class method can be decorated as follows:

    >>> class A(object):
    ...     def __init__(self, name):
    ...         self.name = name
    ...
    ...     @event
    ...     def progress(self, first, second):
    ...         print("Doing something...")

    A.progress is the event.  It is triggered after executing the code in the
    decorated progress routine.

    Now that we have a class with some event, let's create an event handler.

    >>> def handler(self, first, second):
    ...     print("%s %s and %s!" % (first, self.name, second))

    Note that the handler (and signal calls) must have the signature defined
    by the decorated event method.

    This handler only greets the object that triggered the event by using its
    name attribute.  Let's create some instances of A and register our new
    event handler to their progress event.

    >>> a = A("Foo")
    >>> b = A("Bar")
    >>> a.progress += handler
    >>> b.progress += handler

    Now everything has been setup.  When we call the method, the event will be
    triggered:

    >>> a.progress("Hello", "World")
    Doing something...
    Hello Foo and World!
    >>> b.progress(second="Others", first="Hi")
    Doing something...
    Hi Bar and Others!

    What happens if we disobey the call signature?

    >>> c = A("World")
    >>> c.progress(second="World")  # doctest: +IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: progress() missing 1 required positional argument: 'first'

    Class based access is possible as well:

    >>> A.progress(a, "Hello", "Y")
    Doing something...
    Hello Foo and Y!

    Bound methods keep the instance alive:

    >>> f = a.progress
    >>> import weakref, gc
    >>> wr = weakref.ref(a)
    >>> del a
    >>> c=gc.collect()
    >>> assert wr() is not None
    >>> f("Hi", "Z")
    Doing something...
    Hi Foo and Z!

    If we delete the hard reference to the bound method and run the garbage
    collector (to make sure it is run at all), the object will be gone:

    >>> del f
    >>> c=gc.collect()
    >>> assert wr() is None

    def __set__(self, instance, value):
        '''
        This is a NOP preventing that a boundevent instance is stored.

        This prevents  operations like  `a.progress += handler`  to have
        side effects that result in a cyclic reference.
