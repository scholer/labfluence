"""

A minor note about python decorators:
They are defined as though they were classes.
They implement e.g. __init__ , __call__
(similar to what you could do in a normal object -- although you usually only override __init__)
and __get__
Example (PS: only works for new-style objects; uses mixin I think...)

class cached_property(object):
    '''
    Decorator for making cached properties with read/write/expire ability.
    The property is evaluated only once within TTL period, unless specifically
    expired or re-set.

    Based on the original cached_property by Christopher Arndt, but with a few additions:

    *   I could never remember how to expire a cache, so I've implemented __del__ to do
        this now. To expire the cache, simply invoke
            del obj.MyCachedProperty
        where CachedProperty is the attribute on your object obj, as per the example below:

    *   I would like to be able to re-set the property if I do the calculations somewhere else.
        (However, this is probably usually Not A Good Idea (tm)).

    *   Setting ttl to a negative value should disable caching (it will always be expired).

    This decorator can be used to created a cached property like this::

            # the class containing the property must be a new-style class
            class MyClass(object):
                # create property whose value is cached for ten minutes
                @cached_property(ttl=600)   # Set cache time to 600 seconds
                def MyCachedProperty(self):
                    # will only be evaluated every 10 min.
                    return really_long_calculation()
            obj = MyClass()
            print obj.MyCachedProperty  # Slow first time.
            print obj.MyCachedProperty  # Fast
            newval = calculation_from_alternative_source()
            obj.MyCachedProperty = newval   # Re-set property with new value.
            print obj.MyCachedProperty  # Fast
            del obj.MyCachedProperty    # Expire the cache (does not actually delete the attribute)
            print obj.MyCachedProperty  # Slow.

    Alternatively, the cached property can be expired manually by deleting the cache entry:

        del obj._cache[<property name>]

    The value is cached  in the '_cache' attribute of the object instance that
    has the property getter method wrapped by this decorator. The '_cache'
    attribute value is a dictionary which has a key for every property of the
    object which is wrapped by this decorator. Each entry in the cache is
    created only when the property is accessed for the first time and is a
    two-element tuple with the last computed property value and the last time
    it was updated in seconds since the epoch.

    The default time-to-live (TTL) is 300 seconds (5 minutes). Set the TTL to
    zero for the cached value to never expire.

    Note that, unlike the property decorator, this decorator must be instantiated
    before it is used to wrap a method. This is because here the decoration is
    done by passing the method-to-be-wrapped to __call__, while in the property
    decorator the method-to-be-wrapped is passed to __init__ during instantiation.
    For this decorator, __init__ is used to customize the decorator, setting
    ttl and (in theory) other attributes.

    Thus, to use this property you MUST do:
        @cached_property()  # Notice the parenthesis
        def mymethod(...)
    this will NOT work:
        @cached_property    # Will not work without parenthesis;
        def mymethod        # since mymethod will then be passed to __init__
