# Note: When I invoke these, it appears the cwd is automatically
# changed to the repo root dir, which is also the dir from where
# pytest should be invoked. Thus, these hooks work nicely:
# 1. Run pytest after updating the working directory
# (It is good practice to ensure that tests succeed before starting to make changes)
update.pytest = python -m pytest
# 2. Run pytest before committing (all tests should succeed before committing).
precommit.pytest = python -m pytest
# Note: python modules can also be invoked using:
# precommit.hookname = python:module.submodule.callable
# precommit.hookname = python:/path/to/module.py:callable
# For pytest from python, http://pytest.org/latest/usage.html#pytest-main-usage
# precommit.pytest = python:pytest:main # Nope, doesn't work.

# Important notice for using python:modules invokation
# The modules will be invoked using the python process invoked for hg.
# If you have installed hg on windows with TortoiseHg, the 
# python interpreter is a minimal install located in the library.zip
# file in the TortoiseHg installation directory.
# This will, of course, not include extra python modules,
# in particular, it will not include pytest.
