Labfluence is primarily intended for researchers who uses Atlassian's 
Confluence wiki system as research documentation system and electronic 
laboratory notebook (ELN). It is based on a fat object model system that 
may be utilized either with through a light-weight Tkinter-based GUI, or 
from the command line. Do you love to use the the Confluence system as 
your primary lab journal, but hate the repeated "Edit page -- Add 
journal entry -- Save page -- Repeat" workflow required to make a single 
entry? Or do avoid this by keeping the page in edit mode throughout your 
experiment---and then forget to save the page? If either of that applies 
to you, then Labfluence is probably what you need. 

Labfluence also makes it easy to create new experiments, creating a new 
wiki page (template based) and a corresponding local folder with the 
correct foldername. 

Labfluence further works as the nexus of many operations related to 
handling experimental data, including syncing from satellite datastores 
(e.g. equipment computers), and up- and downloading files to/from the 
wiki. 

Note that Labfluence is designed to work in a context where all 
experiments are given a unique ID. Each experiment is usually divided 
into a sequence of individual steps, e.g. a="product reaction/assembly", 
b="purification", c="sample analysis I", etc. 

Wiki-related features include: 
* Effortless creation of new experiment pages from templates (inserting 
experiment IDs, dates, etc). 
* An easy-to-use journal assistant, which time-stamps all journal 
entries and inserts it at the right place on the page. A local cache 
ensures that the journal entries are first written to the wiki after a 
designated time interval, avoiding flooding of the server with save 
requests. 


General features include:
* Parse your local experiment data and locate corresponding wiki page. 
* Sync from remote/satellite data store.
* An easily customizable, location-aware configuration handler that 
makes it possible to have different naming schemes for different folders 
(e.g. different years or projects).
